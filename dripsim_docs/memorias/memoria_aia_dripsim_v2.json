Analyzed the provided GitHub README, which matches the previously created README.md (artifact_id: b5821e41-03f2-4917-8a85-aa71a2467e50) with minor adjustments (e.g., 'Vale do São Francisco' and step numbering). Verified that .gitignore and .gitattributes are correctly set up for Unity files and large assets (.blend, .psd, .tiff) with Git LFS."

Provided a guide for terrain setup with URP shaders."
