    "objective": "Support the development of the DripSim 3D farm simulator by addressing script integration and planning props for modeling, focusing on irrigated fruit farming (mango and grape) in the sub-médio São Francisco region using Unity 3D and C#.",
    "activities": [
      {
        "task": "Clarify script usage",
        "description": "Confirmed that scripts PlayerController.cs, IrrigationSystem.cs, and PlantSystem.cs are created in dripsim_game/Assets/Scripts but not yet integrated. Provided detailed steps to set up SampleScene.unity with a terrain, player, camera, and prefabs for drippers and plants, integrating the scripts for movement, irrigation, and planting mechanics."

      {
        "task": "Create prop list",
        "description": "Generated an organized list of props for DripSim, categorized by complexity: low (e.g., dry soil, rocks), medium (e.g., dripper, water reservoir), and high (e.g., mango tree, grape vine). Detailed implementation for each, including Blender modeling, .fbx export to dripsim_game/Assets/Prefabs, and integration with existing scripts."
      },
      {
        "task": "Support Blender modeling",
        "description": "Provided guidance for modeling props in Blender, including file organization (dripsim_assets/models for .blend, dripsim_assets/textures for .png), export settings for .fbx, and integration with Unity (URP materials, prefabs). Suggested starting with drippers and dry soil textures."

        "description": "Created a new script, WaterReservoir.cs (artifact_id: 9dc8a90c-dd11-4b27-9294-c56683652451), to visually update the water level in a reservoir prefab based on IrrigationSystem.currentWaterLevel, with instructions for setup in Unity."

      "Model props in Blender (e.g., dripper, dry soil, mango tree) and save .blend files in dripsim_assets/models, exporting .fbx to dripsim_game/Assets/Prefabs.",
      "Configure SampleScene.unity with terrain, player, and prefabs, integrating PlayerController.cs, IrrigationSystem.cs, and PlantSystem.cs for testing.",
      "Create textures (.png, .jpg) in dripsim_assets/textures for semi-arid and irrigated areas, applying to terrain with URP shaders.",
      "Implement UI with UI Toolkit in dripsim_game/Assets/UI for water level, seed inventory, and plant status.",
      "Commit new models, prefabs, and textures to the GitHub repository (https://github.com/valdomiromorais/dripsim.git)."
