        "description": "Analyzed the updated .gitignore (artifact_id: fb26a437-51af-4ebd-b320-d81fe14f9497), which now ignores Rider configurations (**/.idea/*) with exceptions for codeStyles and inspectionProfiles, and folder_content.txt. Confirmed it correctly prevents version control of unnecessary IDE and temporary files while maintaining shared code style settings."

        "description": "Reviewed the updated directory structure from directory_tree.txt, noting new subfolders dripsim_assets/referencias (for reference images) and dripsim_docs/memorias (for session memory files). Confirmed dripsim_game/Assets remains ready for prefabs and scripts, with standard Unity folders (Library, ProjectSettings) correctly ignored by .gitignore."

Provided guidance for integrating models with PlayerController.cs, IrrigationSystem.cs, and PlantSystem.cs in SampleScene.unity, and committing to GitHub (https://github.com/valdomiromorais/dripsim.git)."
